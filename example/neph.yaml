# This is an example build file. If you feel that something is missing from it or hard to understand, please open an issue.

# *** DO NOT RUN THIS FILE, IT HAS SIDE EFFECTS! ***

# The main build file can contain one or two YAML documents.
# The first is the build configuration, the second contains the job definitions.

# This is the config part.
# If this is missing, (the file contains only one YAML document), the default values will be used.
# Any key can be left out (the default value will be used).

# The interpreter that is used to run the commands.
# type:          string or array of string
# default value: "sh"
# If it is a string, then it has to be one of the following:
#   - sh
#   - bash
#   - zsh
#   - elvish (By the way, this is a great shell, check it out: https://elvish.io)
# These shells has built in support in Neph.
#
# If it is an array, then the first item is the name of the executable file,
# and the others are the arguments passed to it.
# If an argument is equal to '/command' it will be replaced with the launched command.
# If any argument starts with a '/' character, then one '/' will be removed from the
# beginning of the string. So if '/command' should be passed to the interpreter as it is, it has
# to be written as '//command'.
# The Elvish shell can't read commands from standard input, so it is passed to it as an argument:
# Remember, it has builtin support, so the following could be written as
# interpreter: elvish
interpreter:
  - elvish
  - -c
  - /command

# The list of environment variables.
# type:          mapping of string to string
# default value: empty
environment:
  EDITOR: kak # Very good editor, check it out: http://kakoune.org
  PAGER: slit # https://github.com/tigrawap/slit

# The list of included build files.
# type:          array of strings
# default value: empty
# Each string can contain shell-style wildcards, these are expanded during parsing.
# The external build files can't have a config part, so they can only contain one YAML document.

# This is the second document.
# It contains the job definitions.

# The job list is a mapping of string to mapping.
# The keys are the job names, the values are the job definitions.
# Job definitions have to be mappings.

  # The list of commands that are evaluated by the interpreter.

    # A command can contain complex code, e.g. an Elvish `if` structure:
    - if (crystal tool format --check) {
        git commit
      } else {
        echo (styled "please format the code before committing" red)
